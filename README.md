# Twitter-bot
Two ideas of where I could take this bot:
1. Sentiment analysis: Fetch tweet, run it through a model, output a categorisation (eg. happy or sad)
2. Captioning: Fetch tweet with picture, run it through a CNN, output a caption (Twitter captioning bot?)

To do: 
* Create a new Twitter account, get new access tokens etc and start working with that
* Set up the CNN (loading an image from file, process the image into a format we can input to a CNN, try to predict the label which is a short description of the image).
